## Region Map

| Region | Purpose | Owner Agent |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| [project/](project/index.md) | Vision, state, and architectural decisions | Architect |
| [agents/](agents/index.md) | Agent definitions, domains, and rules | Architect |
| [context/](context/index.md) | Living codebase map, patterns, failures, dependencies | Builder / Tester |
| [quality/](quality/index.md) | Duplication tracking, debt log, pruning proposals | Quality |
| [flows/](flows/index.md) | Orchestration flow definitions and success criteria | Architect / Evaluator |

---

## Current Phase

**Phase 8 complete — BonsaiAF 0.1.0 live on PyPI**

`pip install bonsaiaf` is live. pyproject.toml, README.md, and package artifacts all published. Zero required dependencies. Anthropic SDK optional via `bonsaiaf[api]`.

## Health Table

| Region | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| project/ | in progress | Vision, state, and decisions written; state reflects Phase 3 complete |
| agents/ | in progress | All five agent definitions written; reconnaissance agent fully implemented |
| context/ | in progress | Codebase map updated (Phase 3); dependency map current; patterns registry has two entries |
| quality/ | initialized | Schema defined, no entries yet |
| flows/ | initialized | Greenfield and brownfield flows written |

Status legend: `initialized` → `in progress` → `complete` → `degraded`

## Next Priority

Share with the world, gather feedback, iterate.
